## objectives
* build Amity a proper website to showcase her as athlete and dieititian  
* learn and utilize Astro
* include a gallery of images, with caption animation  
* build a contact page!  
* incorporate a blog with stories, recipies, podcasts, and more  
* responsive design - for desktop, tablet, mobile  
* cross-browser functionality - tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari  
  
## reflections  
* I'm happy with the result! Proud of how it turned out.  
* learned about Astro, about differences between browsers (particularly regarding background image in Safari mobile), about forms (and their functionality).  
* I spent a lot of time on little details, not sure many folks will notice but I hope the site provides a polished/professional feel.  

## screenshots  
* full screen

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
