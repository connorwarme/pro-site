"On a chilly spring evening in early April, Amity Warme and Brent Barghahn scrambled onto the summit of El Capitan, exhausted and overjoyed. They had just topped out Freerider (VI 5.13a; 32 pitches) in a truly enviable style: In a little over 18 hours, without support, rap rehearsal, or stashed gear, they both free climbed the route, making Warme only the fifth woman to free the Big Stone in a day, and likely the first to do so in this self-reliant style. 

Maybe you’ve seen Warme before. She has rippled, wide shoulders and even wider eyes—and constantly strives to climb in a pure, ground-up style. For the second spring season in a row she’s turned heads in the Valley, with ticks of El Corazon (5.13b; 32 pitches), Mark of the Beast (5.13b; six pitches), Cosmic Debris (5.13b), Border Country (5.12c), America’s Cup (5.12b), and Steck-Salathé (5.10; 15 pitches) as well as taking down the Freerider in a day with Barghahn."
