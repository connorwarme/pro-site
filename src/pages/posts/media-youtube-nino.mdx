In an era where many climbers are using fixed ropes and sport-climbing tactics to free El Cap, climbers like Amity Warme and Brent Barghahn are choosing to keep adventure alive. Going ground up, Amity and Brent pull off a free ascent of the Pineapple Express variation of El Niño (5.13b/c) over eight days, battling variable conditions, friable rock, and, for Amity, a serious finger injury.
