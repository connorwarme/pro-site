### Yield: 
10 Muffins

### Ingredients:

  * 1 cup plant-based milk of choice
  * 1 Tbsp lemon juice or white vinegar
  * 2 overripe bananas
  * 2 large eggs
  * 2 tsp vanilla
  * 2 ½ cups flour (see note below for options)
  * ½ tsp cinnamon, plus extra for sprinkling on top
  * 1 tsp sea salt
  * 2 tsp baking powder
  * ½ tsp baking soda
  * 2 scoops Enduro Bites Recovery Protein, vanilla
  * 1 ½ - 2 cups blackberries (fresh or frozen)

### Instructions:

  * Combine plant-based milk of choice and lemon juice or vinegar in a liquid measuring cup and let sit for 5 minutes. 
  * In a large mixing bowl, mash the bananas thoroughly. Add the eggs, vanilla, and buttermilk and stir to combine. 
  * Next, add the flour, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and Vanilla Recovery Protein Powder to the bowl. Stir until just combined. 
  * Fold in the blackberries.
  * Cover bowl and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. 
  * When you are ready to bake your muffins, preheat the oven to 425o F and prepare a muffin tin by greasing each muffin cup with cooking spray.
  * Remove batter from the fridge. Batter will be thick but try not to stir it as you scoop batter into each muffin cup. Fill to the top! This recipe should divide into 10 muffins.
  * Sprinkle a dash of cinnamon on the top of each muffin.
  * Bake at 425o F for 8 minutes. Then, reduce heat to 350o F and bake for another 12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
  * Remove the muffins from the oven and cool in the pan on a cooling rack. Then remove from the pan with a plastic knife or fork and enjoy!

### Notes:

  * Make it vegan: 
    - Replace eggs with flax eggs
  * Flour options: whole wheat flour, white whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, gluten-free all-purpose blend, whole wheat pastry flour
    - These will all yield slightly different flavors and textures. Whole wheat will be denser while all-purpose will be lighter and fluffier. White whole wheat will fall in between. I haven’t experimented with gluten-free, but I imagine it would work just fine.
  * For a sweeter muffin, add a few tablespoons of honey or pure maple syrup to the batter
