Summary from Doc:

Big wall climber Amity Warme sits down with Doc to discuss the highs and lows of scaling 3,000-foot vertical wall faces.  Along the way, the two of them cover route topos, crux pitches, sweaty fingers, off-widths, chicken wings, and all the things you've ever wanted to know about porta-ledges. All the things.
