"In early February, pro climber and dietician Amity Warme sent the Joshua Tree test piece, Stingray 5.13d. Located in the Wall Street Mill Area of Wonderland South, the route is a splitter overhanging finger crack with painful jams and lousy feet. Mike Paul first freed Stingray on top-rope back in 1988. Shortly afterwards, Hidetaka Suzuki became the first person to successfully lead the route."
