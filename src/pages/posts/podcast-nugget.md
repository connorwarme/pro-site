Summary from Steven:

Amity Warme is one of the most badass trad climbers you’ve never heard of. She also has a master’s in sports nutrition. We talked about her incredible season in Yosemite including ground-up free ascents of ‘Freerider’ and ‘Golden Gate’, the importance of logistics in big wall free climbing, what she learned growing up in gymnastics, training plans, and eating more to do more.
