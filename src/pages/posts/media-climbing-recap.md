"...In the other newsworthy ascent, over May 24 and 29 and climbing from the ground without pre-inspection or pre-stashing of haul bags, Warme and Karow freed the 36-pitch 5.13a Golden Gate. They didn’t know which key placements had to go where, and they had to figure everything out on the fly.

'It really does increase the challenge,' Warme says. 'Going into the 5.13 "Golden Desert" pitch, I took the whole rack with me.'"
