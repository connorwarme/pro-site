### Ingredients

  * 3 very ripe bananas
  * ¼ cup almond butter or tahini
  * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  * ¼ cups honey or pure maple syrup
  * 5 cups old fashioned oats
  * 2 teaspoons cinnamon
  * ½ teaspoon sea salt
  * 2 scoops Enduro Bites Vanilla [Recovery Protein](https://enduro-bites.myshopify.com/products/recovery-protein-by-enduro-bites) 

### Instructions

  * Preheat oven to 325°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper
  * Mash bananas in a large mixing bowl
  * Add almond butter or tahini, vanilla, and honey or maple syrup and mix well
  * Stir in oats, cinnamon, sea salt, and Recovery Protein until well combined
  * Arrange mixture on baking sheets, using fingers to make small clumps
  * Bake for 30-35 minutes or until starting to brown, stirring halfway through

Once cooled, we like to store this in small re-sealable containers or ziplock bags so it’s easy to grab a serving or two as we’re heading out he door.
