Summary from Ryan:  
  
Elite climber Amity Warme shares her process, struggles, and learnings as she projected (but hasn't yet sent) one of the hardest trad routes in the world, Cobra Crack.  
  
Amity is a trad and big wall crusher, boasting ground-up ascents of El Nino, El Corazon, Golden Gate, and the Freerider routes of El Cap, plus other hard trad lines such as Book of Hate (13d / 8b) which she recently sent with a fully ruptured A2 pulley. In this conversation we discuss:
  
* Why she chose Cobra as her hardest project yet  
* Going from 9 days as her longest project to more than 30 for Cobra  
* Training on the project (and why it didn't work)  
* Sunk Cost Theory, and questioning whether the struggle was worth it  
* The emotional rollercoaster of projecting at her limit  
* Shoe beta  
* The impact of 'micro-underfueling'  
* Sending her hardest routes in the Valley... with a fully ruptured A2 pulley
