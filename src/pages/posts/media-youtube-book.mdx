Book of Hate is a 45 meter pitch of strenuous stemming up a progressively steepening corner in Yosemite Valley. First climbed by Randy Leavitt, this route is a true test piece of difficult stem climbing. It is mostly bolted, but relies on the smallest of trad gear in the  overhung crux section near the top. SCARPA Athlete Amity Warme dug deep and put together an impressive send despite climbing with what she later found out to be a fully ruptured A2 pulley in her middle finger! (**not recommended!!!**)

The reel from this climb went viral, with over 100+ million views across Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit.
