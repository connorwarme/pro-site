Connor and I went on a little end of the season adventure up (most of) the Chief, climbing The Alaska Highway (5.11d, 5 pitches) into The Calling (5.12a, 3 pitches). We chose to rap after the high quality pitches on The Calling, but you can continue to quest up to the top. 

We just threw together a handful of clips to make a quick recap video. We aren't video people and aren't pretending to be either...but we're open to providing some glimpses into our experiences if y'all are interested. Happy to hear feedback and ideas for future content.

It was a beautiful day! Only some short-lived wet sections, thankfully, despite the deluge of rain a few days ago. 

Check it out!
