"Sometimes climbers and their achievements are so remarkable they make my job easy; they leave no doubt I will write about them. My last column about Madaleine Sorkin climbing the world’s hardest high-altitude free route, was one of these.

Now I’ve been gifted another, on the same vertical stage — the nearly 1,000-foot tall granite wall called the Diamond on Longs Peak — but on a different extreme route: The Honeymoon Is Over (5.13c). Of its 8 pitches, 3 are rated 5.13. Each of these boasts insecure movement on tiny holds, plus short, powerful sections that require poise as much as power.

This rarely climbed route had seen just one female ascent, by Sorkin, in 2016. But this summer 3 local women — Amity Warme, Lynn Anderson and Katie Kelble — stormed the climb, working both independently and together."
