Take a lesson from climber Amity Warme—climbing is trying hard.  

Coming into the climbing world relatively late, Amity has quickly established herself as one of the world's best big wall free climbers. 

With four free routes up El Cap under her belt, plus a plethora of other difficult multi and single-pitch climbs, Amity’s quick success on stone is unheard of. Her secret? “Trying REALLY hard,” she says. “I can work hard, I can try hard, and I can give absolutely 100 percent,” she says.  

But everyone—even Amity—needs to make space for some R&R. Finding a fresh perspective through climbing, she’s learning to balance her energy and expectations on and off the rocks. 

“There are bigger things in life,” Amity says. “It’s important to not get too caught up in what I’m doing. At the end of the day, I want to be recognized as a positive influence.”
