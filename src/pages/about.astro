<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
  <p>You'll often find me exceedingly stoked and always in motion, often rock climbing. I'm constantly pursuing the next big adventure. I find climbing compelling because it provides the opportunity for me to push my limits, physically and mentally, while exploring incredible landscapes and connecting with others in the mountain adventure tribe. I live in a van with my husband, Connor. We spend much of the year traveling to climbing destinations, seeking out adventures big and small. A couple of my favorite zones are Yosemite, CA, Indian Creek, UT, and Rocky Mountain National Park, CO. My secret climbing superpower is trying REALLY hard - I donâ€™t give up! Feel free to say hi if you ever see me around!!</p>
  <h2>Why Climbing?</h2>
    <p>I thrive on the opportunity to push myself both physically and mentally. Climbing provides a space for me to continually test my limits while also connecting with the world around me on a deeper level. I love digging deep to accomplish a goal.</p>
    <p>I also appreciate connecting with climbing partners through a shared experience. I am always amazed at the accomplishments that teamwork and mutual stoke can lead to and I value learning from those around me. I find great joy in empowering others to believe in themselves and their ability to achieve something great.</p>
  <h2>Why Nutrition?</h2>
