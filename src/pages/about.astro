      <p>You'll often find me exceedingly stoked and always in motion, often rock climbing. I'm constantly pursuing the next big adventure.</p>
      <p>My secret climbing superpower is trying REALLY hard - I donâ€™t give up!</p>
      <p>Feel free to say hi if you ever see me around!!</p>

      <h2>Why Climbing?</h2>
      <p>
        I find climbing compelling because it provides the opportunity to challenge myself while exploring incredible landscapes and connecting with others in the mountain adventure tribe.
        I thrive when an objective pushes me to the limit, physically and mentally. I love digging deep to accomplish a goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy all climbing disciplines but feel most drawn to big wall climbing because it requires a combination of every skill in your repertoire in order to pull off a successful ascent!
      </p>
      <p>
        I also appreciate connecting with climbing partners through a shared experience. I am always amazed at the accomplishments that teamwork and mutual stoke can lead to and I value learning from those around me. 
        I find great joy in empowering others to believe in themselves and their ability to achieve something great.

      <h2>Why Nutrition?</h2>
      <p>
        I've been immersed in 'weight sensitive' sports my entire life. 
        I'm acutely aware of the harmful mental and physical effects of underfueling, in one's athletic performance and long-term health.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up doing competitive gymnastics. While I was fortunate to have positive role models around me as a young gymnast I still saw the negative ramifications of underfueling in others.
        I suffered a career ending back injury, which may have been partly related to unintentional nutritional deficiencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finding climbing, I became more aware of a pervasive attitude around weight and diet that encouraged underfueling. 
        I saw this play out in my climbing journey and experienced the negative effects firsthand, and I have witnessed it in countless climbers around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having long had an interest in sports performance and physiology, along with a passion for food and cooking, it seemed like a natural connection to integrate both aspects into a career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, my goal is to help athletes use nutrition to maximize their performance while protecting long term health!
