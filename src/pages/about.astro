        <p>You'll often find me exceedingly stoked and always in motion, often rock climbing. I'm constantly pursuing the next big adventure.</p>
        <p>My secret climbing superpower is trying REALLY hard - I donâ€™t give up!</p>
        <p>Feel free to say hi if you ever see me around!!</p>

        <h2 class="about-animate">Why Climbing?</h2>
        <p>
          I find climbing compelling because it provides the opportunity to challenge myself while exploring incredible landscapes and connecting with others in the mountain adventure tribe.
          I thrive when an objective pushes me to the limit, physically and mentally. I love digging deep to accomplish a goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy all climbing disciplines but feel most drawn to big wall climbing because it requires a combination of every skill in your repertoire in order to pull off a successful ascent!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also appreciate connecting with climbing partners through a shared experience. I am always amazed at the accomplishments that teamwork and mutual stoke can lead to and I value learning from those around me. 
          I find great joy in empowering others to believe in themselves and their ability to achieve something great.

      <div class="about-nutrition">
        <h2 class="about-animate">Why Nutrition?</h2>
        <p>
          I've been immersed in 'weight sensitive' sports my entire life. 
          I'm acutely aware of the harmful mental and physical effects of underfueling, in one's athletic performance and long-term health.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up doing competitive gymnastics. While I was fortunate to have positive role models around me as a young gymnast I still saw the negative ramifications of underfueling in others.
          I suffered a career ending back injury, which may have been partly related to unintentional nutritional deficiencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finding climbing, I became more aware of a pervasive attitude around weight and diet that encouraged underfueling. 
          I saw this play out in my climbing journey and experienced the negative effects firsthand, and I have witnessed it in countless climbers around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having long had an interest in sports performance and physiology, along with a passion for food and cooking, it seemed like a natural connection to integrate both aspects into a career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my goal is to help athletes use nutrition to maximize their performance while protecting long term health!
